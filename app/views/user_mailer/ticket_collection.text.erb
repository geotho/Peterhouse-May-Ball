Dear all,

This email contains important information about ticket collection and Ball entry. It is only being sent to the primary ticket holder - please forward it to your guests as appropriate.

Ticket collection for current members of the University will be on:
Saturday 13th June from 11am until 5pm
Sunday 14th June from 11am until 5pm
Tickets can be collected from the Peterhouse JCR in the new Whittle Building in Gisborne Court.

In addition to the above ticket collection dates, alumni will be able to collect tickets from the Supervision Room in 4 St. Peter’s Terrace from 4pm until 8pm on the day of the Ball.

You are required to bring photo ID to collect your tickets.
Tickets will be provided individually, rather than as pairs.
Whether you are a current student or an alumnus, you may also nominate someone to collect your tickets for you. To do so, please email me with details of who will be collecting your tickets. They must bring your photo ID and the email address of the account under which the tickets were purchased.

On the evening, entry to the Ball will depend on your ticket type:
Standard guests enter at Grove Lane (opposite Brown’s restaurant) from 9pm;
Champagne Reception and Queue Jump guests enter at Grove Lane from 8pm;
Dining guests enter at the Porter’s Lodge on Trumpington Street at 6pm;
VIP guests attend a reception at the Master’s Lodge from 8.15pm.

All guests are required to bring photo ID and their ticket with them on the evening.
As a reminder, the dress code of the Ball is white tie preferred. Both black tie and national dress are also acceptable. Failure to meet this dress code could result in refused entry to the Ball.

Please let me know if you have any additional queries.

Many thanks,
George Thomas
Ticketing Officer
