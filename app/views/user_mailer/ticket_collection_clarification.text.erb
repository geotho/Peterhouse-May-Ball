Dear all,

Further to my previous email regarding ticket collection, allow me to clarify that the primary ticket holder (the person to whom this email is being sent) is responsible for collecting all tickets purchased under their account.

To collect your ticket and your guest tickets, you are required to bring your photo ID. You are not required to bring the photo IDs of your guests.

Your guests will not be able to collect tickets themselves unless you email beforehand and they bring your photo ID.

As a reminder, ticket collect times and locations are as follows:
Saturday 13th June from 11am until 5pm in the Peterhouse JCR
Sunday 14th June from 11am until 5pm in the Peterhouse JCR
Wednesday 17th June from 4pm until 8pm in the Supervision Room in 4 St. Peterâ€™s Terrace, for alumni or by special request only.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any other questions.
