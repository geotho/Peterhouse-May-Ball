Dear all,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m writing with some further information about white tie hire with Moss Bros. For those of you who have already ordered your white tie, please note that you will need to collect your outfits from June 9th onwards, from the Moss Bros store on St. John’s St, Cambridge. After the Ball, outfits may be returned to either Moss Bros store in Cambridge, on or before June 19th.

If you are still interested in taking advantage of the discounted hire rate, please pop into any Moss Bros store before May 30th in order to place your order.

I do hope that this is clear, and please get in touch if you have any queries.

Please forward this information to your guests (anyone named on your tickets): this email has only been sent to the primary ticket holder.

Best wishes,

Georgia Kandunias

Secretary & Sponsorship Officer
The Peterhouse May Ball Committee, 2015
