Dear all,

I hope you are all beginning to look forward to the upcoming Peterhouse May Ball! I am writing with some further
information about discounted white tie hire for all guests. For a special hire rate of Â£85.50, Moss Bros will be
supplying guests with full white tie outfits, which include tailcoat, trousers, Marcella vest, shirt, bow tie and
stud pack. They will also provide an accidental damage waiver with all outfits.

All guests are eligible to take advantage of this opportunity, should they so wish. Do bear in mind that white tie is
optional, and that we expect to see a mixture of white tie and black tie on the evening.

For those who are not members of Peterhouse, please visit any Moss Bros store (in Cambridge and nationwide) and mention
that you are a guest of the Peterhouse May Ball in Cambridge. Please also bring proof of attendance to the Ball,
such as a printout of the ticketing page.

Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions.

Best wishes,
Georgia Kandunias
Secretary & Sponsorship Officer
The Peterhouse May Ball Committee, 2015
